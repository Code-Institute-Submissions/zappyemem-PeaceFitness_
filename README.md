   - Services: This section is designed to show the users the different programs and classes offered by the gym to                            its members to help them get closer towards achieving their desired goals.

               It displays an overlay offering the users to subscribe and get a 30days free trials to test out the                            gym. This way we can build the trust of our clients even before they finally become our members.

   Existing features:
  
   - The welcome feature on the home page section allows users to have access to the membership suscription by clicking on the      'Jion now' button. By having them feel out the subcription form.
     
   
   
   
   Another feature idea:

   - In the future, the idea is to have a section below the services section - A carousel displaying slided pictures                of people in the gym with different machines. This is to display more funtions avaliable for the users. 

   - Feature left to be implemented:
     Also in the future the subscription, Join now and contact forms should be connected and functional for real                    time user experience rather than static. 
   
   - Password reset by email: gmail setting required when/if site is finally deployed to be in use which is not                     relevant now. 

   - Sending an email to customer when their new order has been placed - gmail setting required when/if site is                     finally deployed to be in use which is not relevant now. 

   - Subscription and payment method : Where client can send payment to through account and get confirmation                        response. Which is not neccessary now.

   - Terms and Conditions / Privacy Policy pages - Legal documents to back up the trust that exits between the                      clients and the gym adminstrations. This will protect both parties.

   Testing:
   
   This project is a static and intuitive one which makes some of its features difficult to test as future work needs to be      done. However, the links on the navbar to the the sections have been tested and funtions well.
   
   Every link takes you to the right sections. the home page keep the user on the first section since it is the homepage.        Though I am aware the homepage on the navbar could be deleted since it takes the user no where other than the first page      that could be seen already. The reason why is there is to let them know that is the Homepage. Every sections have been        tested to ensure they all work well as intended.

   The pictures works fine on the different sactions including the background pictures. 
   All links used for icons and buttons are tested to function well for the user experirnce to be achieved. Every details have    been provided to give the user a straightforward
   guidance towards achieving their goals. 
   
   These test have been done manually by me checking them out on the external website to ensure results are shown as expected. 
   - The Html test code - code was ran on the html testing site through W3C markup validation service website -        https://validator.w3.org/,
  
  - Html viewer code beautify - https://codebeautify.org/htmlviewer/, 

   
   Contact page:
      In the "Contact Us" page section 
   - I have tried to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
          
   - I have tried to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
          
   - I have tried ry to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
   
   - The gym website has been tested and looks great on different screen sizes and works well on different browerser. I             have also tested them on the "Inspect" section on the web.

   
   More on the Contact page:
               1. The contact page contains a form for the user to fill in to send the gym an email address.
               2. Name, email address and message are all required fields so that the shop owner receives all the information                   she needs to respond.
               3. If the user has logged in, then their email address will be registered in the email field.
               4. When the user clicks "send" the email is processed and sent via email to The Peace Fitness email                           address.

  First Milestone Project
       Project's Name - Peace Fitness Gym:
  
              Peace Fitness Gym is a general body fitness center for good health and personal develop. The ability to deliver your goal with excellence through a progressive actualization of a predetermined goal. 
                   The goal is to encourage members work header and get stronger while living a healthy life style.
                       The gym provides different services that would help members remain focus towards achieving thier goals. It has flexible opening hours and personal trainer that would fit individual time table. 

  

        A brief project method:
            As mentioned earlier the aim of the project is to reach out to people who are interested in change, personal development, fitness and in living a healthy lifestyle. The passion is driven from my love for 
               staying healthy, maintaining a sound mind, pyhsical fitness and my love for gym. Also is my passion to see people achieve their goals through hardwork. I feel starting up a gym will give me a platform 
                 help reach out to many who are currently struggling with weight loss, low self esteem and poor dieting leading to poor health conditions. 
            
            After going through all the courses I have gathered little knowledge on how to design a simple website like this. I also watched lots of tutorials and got the section designs from looking at different gym sites 
              e.g https://www.friskissvettis.se/ and https://se.fitness24seven.com/vara-gym/se-vara-gym/goteborg-kviberg/
               Futher details about the project are given below.  
  
   User Experience process:

      This project is designed for everyone, young, old, female or male irrespective of their sizes. The aim of the gym is to promote and encourage 
      a healthy lifestyle and sound health for people. There are certified trainers avaliable for people that may require special training as well as every other persons that
      requires one. Hence, the gym provides a free consultation for its members. 
   
      There are several benefit attached to being a member at our gym ranging from proffessional advice to up-to-date equipments and machines
      put in place to help members achieve their desired goals.
       
      The gym provides classes, group trainings, free consultations, trainers, equipment for all levels i.e light, heavy, medium weight
      to best suit each members level of activities. The machines can be set to desired levels and many more. Group activities are created to inspire members as training together can 
      help build relationships and consistency toward arriving at set goals. 
      Different actions are put in place that will help them achieve their goals. 
   
   
   
   Features:

             - Navbar: The navbar is designed to give the users a quick access to the different informations that has been provided to assist them. 
                       Such as: Home, The About section, Services provided, Features sections and the contact Us.
  
           
             - Home:   The homepage shows an overview of the inside of the gym. Displaying some of the many machines avaliable for the users during their time at the gym
                       It also displays an overlay of a welcome text for the users experience and interaction. This is to have an easy way to access the membership form.
  
             
             - About:  This section is to keep thr user informed about the gym. Its aim and why they should choose to gym with us. 
  
            
             - Services: This section is designed to show the users the different programs and classes offered by the gym to its members to help them get closer towards achieving their desired goals. 
  
             
             - Features: This section is designed to to reassure the user that they are making the right choice to gym with us. With a guarantee of certified trainers, free consultants and flexiblity to suit each member. 
                         It displays an overlay offering the users to subscribe and get a 30days free trials to test out the gym. This way we can build the trust of our clients even before they finally become our members. 
  
             
             - Contact Us: This section is designed to enable users share their thoughts on any matter and ask for more informations.

                       and the location of the gym.

  
  
   Existing features:
  
             - The welcome feature on the home page section allows users to have access to the membership suscription by clicking on the 'Jion now' button. By having them feel out the subcription form.
     
   
   Another feature idea:

             - In the future, the idea is to have a section below the services section - A carousel displaying slided pictures of people in the 
               gym with different machines. This is to display more funtions avaliable for the users. 

             - Feature left to be implemented
                 Also in the future the subscription, Join now and contact forms should be connected and functional for real time user experience rather than static. 
   
             - Password reset by email: gmail setting required when/if site is finally deployed to be in use which is not relevant now. 

             - Sending an email to customer when their new order has been placed - gmail setting required when/if site is finally deployed to be in use which is not relevant now. 

             - Subscription and payment method : Where client can send payment to through account and get confirmation response. Which is not neccessary now.

             - Terms and Conditions / Privacy Policy pages - Legal documents to back up the trust that exits between the clients and the gym adminstrations. This will protect both parties.

   Testing:
   
   This project is a static one which makes some of its features difficult to test as future work needs to be done. However, the links on the navbar to the the sections have been tested and funtions well.
   Every link takes you to the right sections. the home page keep the user on the first section since it is the homepage. Though I am aware the homepage on the navbar could be deleted since it takes the user no 
   where other than the first page that could be seen already. The reason why is there is to let them know that is the Homepage. Every sections have been tested to ensure they all work well as intended.

   The pictures works fine on the different sactions including the background pictures.
